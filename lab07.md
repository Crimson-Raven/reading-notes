### Lab 07
### What is the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol?
The SSH protocol is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. It protects communication security with strong encryption, and provides alternative options for strong authentication.
### What are the typical uses of the SSH protocol?
Some of the typical uses of the SS protocol are providing secure access for users and automated processes, interactive and automated file transfers, issuing remote commands, and managing network infrastructure and other mission-critical system components.
### How does the SSH protocol work?
The SSH protocol works in a client-server model. This means that the connection is established by the SSH client by connecting to the SSH server.
### How is the data kept safe when transmitted between the SSH client and server?
Once the connection is established between the SSH client and server, the data that is transmitted is encrypted. The client and server will agree to use the symmetric encryption algorithm, which generates the encryption key. The traffic and data between communicating parties will be protected with industry standard strong encryption algorithms ( like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)). Using a standard hash algorithm, for example, SHA-2 (Standard Hashing Algorithm), the SSH protocol will include a mechanism that provides integrity of the transmitted data.
### What is SFTP?
The SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is the most widely used and secure file transfer protocol.

### What is Windows Remote Desktop Connection?
Remote Desktop Connection gives users the ability to connect to a PC or server over the internet or on a local network. It enables the user to capture a device's screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs and then transmits that to another device. This is where a user can view and control the remote PC remotely. Tech support professionals often use this to troubleshoot live fixes on client computers. 
### What is RDP?
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) allows remote users to see and use Windows on a device in another location.
### What is the RDP port number?
The RDP port number is 3389. This provides network access to a remote user over an encrypted channel.

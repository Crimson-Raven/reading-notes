### Lab 03
### What is the BIOS?
The BIOS is the Basic Input/Output System, which is stored in the ROM. The BIOS contains all the basic code for controlling your computer hardware. After the operating system takes control, the BIOS does very little. 
### Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
When you turn on a computer, it’s like your brain waking up in the morning. Your brain starts checking to see if all your systems are working properly. If something isn't working properly, the brain sends signals to the rest of the body to try and figure out what's wrong and fix it. That’s what the BIOS does through the POST process when you turn on your pc. 
### What is the “Power On Self Test”?
POST is a process where the BIOS checks the basic hardware components to ensure they are working properly when the computer is turned on. 
### What is the CMOS?
CMOS stands for Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor. The CMOS produces integrated circuits (IC chips), and is used in batteries, microprocessors, digital camera image sensors, and more electronic components. The CMOS is used to store critical data used by the operating system during the booting process. 
### What is the CMOS battery?
The CMOS battery is what powers your computer’s BIOS, which is responsible for booting up your pc and configuring dataflow.

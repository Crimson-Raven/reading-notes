## Reading Notes:
### Lab 05

### Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
Shell: A shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands. A shell reads from input devices like keyboards, or files. This allows users to run commands, programs, and shell scripts. The shell takes human commands and converts them into something the computer can understand.
Terminal: A terminal is a keyboard and a screen. It’s a way to send keystrokes to the server and display any data received on the screen.
Command Prompt: A command prompt is the computer telling you it’s ready to accept a command. The computer is prompting you. It’s a way of asking you to open a terminal to get to a shell.
Cli: The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface to the computer system. This is where the user types in commands and the computer executes it.
These are still used today for multiple reasons. This can play a key part in cyber security, especially when it comes to needing to find hidden files. Or someone might want to modify their computer in a way regular interface would not allow them to.

### What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
Change directories: cd 
List file content: ls
Rename/move files: mv or mv old file name, new file name
### What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
An absolute path is the location of a file or a folder in the operating system from the root directory. A relative path is the location of a file or a folder in the operating system from the current directory.
The tilde (~) is a Linux "shortcut" to the user's home directory. Tilde slash (~/) is the beginning of a path to a directory below the user's home directory.

### Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.

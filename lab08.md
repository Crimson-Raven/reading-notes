### What is an ISO File?
An ISO file is a file that is the perfect representation of a CD, DVD, or BD. The contents of a disk can be duplicated in a single ISO file. The file is no good unless it’s opened, assembled, and then used. An ISO file can also be referred to as an ISO image. 
### How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)?
Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11 all include built-in ISO burner tools. This process works for DVDs, CDs or BDs. Right-click or tap-and-hold the ISO file, then choose Burn disc image to open the Windows Disc Image Burner window. Select Burn to burn the ISO image to the disc.
Select Show more options after right-clicking the file to see the "burn" option, if you're using Windows 11.
On Windows 7, you double-click the ISO file. Double-clicking an ISO in newer Windows versions will mount the file as a virtual disc.
Choose the correct CD, DVD, or BD burner from the Disc burner drop down menu, and make sure there's a blank disc in your disc drive.
### How do you create an ISO file?
There are specific programs, for example: Free ISO Creator and AnyBurn, that let you create an ISO file from a disk or collection of files for free. The most common reason to create an ISO file is to backup a software installation disc, a DVD, or even a Blu-ray movie.
### How do you mount an ISO file?
Open the file with a disc emulator, then choose a drive letter that the ISO file should represent. Windows will see this as a real disc, even though it’s not. You should be able to run it and use it as one. A couple free programs for mounting ISO images is WinCDEmu, this one is easy to use and comes in a portable version. The second one is the Pismo File Mount Audit Package. Modern versions of Windows, such as Windows 10 or 11 have ISO mounting built into the operating system. Tap and hold or right click the ISO file and choose the “Mount” option. Windows will create a virtual drive for you, automatically, and no extra software is needed.

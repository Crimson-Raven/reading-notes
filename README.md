My Ops Reading Notes!
It's important to understand how computers work and what can happen when the wrong people get ahold of information. In order to provide protection and safety to individuals and companies, we first need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of technology. 
How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
Hardware hacks are more difficult to pull off, can be more devastating, and are less common than software hacks. Hardware hacks require you to be in contact with the physical device, whereas software hacks can be done long distance over the internet.
What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?
The first way spies can alter a computer's hardware is through a process called Interdiction, making changes to the device as it’s being transported to the customer. The second way is to alter the device from the very beginning, and planting seeds before it’s shipped out.
Explain how the hack worked.
The chip was able to move down the supply chain undetected, and due to mass production and overseas ties with China, and not having a difficult language barrier, it was easy for information to spread and make plans to infiltrate Supermicro. At the time supply chain security and safety wasn’t as tight as it is today, so a lot could have gone unnoticed. These Chinese manufacturers had been making hacked chips for years, before the U.S. government even knew about them. 
How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
Hardware needed to be physically shipped, which left a history of serial numbers, shipping manifests, and invoices. for each shipment. U.S. intelligence agencies started working backwards down the supply chain, and narrowed their search down to three manufacturers in Taiwan and Shanghai. These U.S. agencies tracked specific individuals through their phones, used tapped informants, and middle men to blend in and learn more about what was going on behind closed doors.

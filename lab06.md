## Reading Notes: 102
### Lab 06
### What makes the Linksys WRT54GL famous?
Linksys' project to let people install open source firmware on new routers without breaking FCC anti-interference rules. 
### Given its age, why do people continue to buy the Linksys WRT54GL?
 Product's reliability, name recognition, and its support of open source firmware.
### What does the “WRT54GL” stand for in the name?
"L" is for "Linux." WRT stands for “Wireless RouTer," 54 symbolizes the speed in Mbps, and G is for 802.11g.
### What did Linksys sell before routers?
Linksys sold consumer routers without wireless capability. They could be used to connect a few devices. A computer, a printer, or a couple of computers. 
### When did Linksys preview their first consumer router?
Linksys previewed their first consumer router in November 1999.
### Who suggested to name it a “router”?
Bill Gates suggested the name “router” in 1999, at a COMDEX computer industry conference.
### What happened when Cisco replaced the Linux-based firmware with the VxWorks platform?
Consumers protested after the replacement made it harder to flash with open source firmware. In 2008, there was a lawsuit filed against Cisco by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). This was a result of Cisco's failure to provide source code. The lawsuit was settled in 2009, Cisco complied with GPL free software licensing, and made a donation to the FSF.
### Why doesn’t the WRT54GL model need to be modified to abide by the new FCC rules?
New FCC rules affect only the 5GHz band. The WRT54GL model operates at 2.4GHz band, and therefore did not need to be modified. 
### Does the WRT54GL model still get updates from Linksys?
Yes, the WRT54GL still receives occasional software updates from Linksys. 
## Things I want to learn more about:
Did Bill Gates receive any type of payment, or credit other than having his name mentioned, for suggesting the name "router"?
